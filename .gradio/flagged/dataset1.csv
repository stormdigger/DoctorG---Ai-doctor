Dandruff can be caused by various factors such as sensitivity to hair care products, dry skin, or even fungal infections. To approach this, I would recommend exploring over-the-counter shampoos labeled as ""anti-dandruff"" or ""medicated"", which contain ingredients like tar, selenium sulfide, or ketoconazole. Additionally, maintaining a healthy scalp through regular washing and ensuring adequate moisture might alleviate the issue.",,2025-03-30 12:53:25.559501
